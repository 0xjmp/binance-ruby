# Binance::Api [![Circle CI](https://circleci.com/gh/Jakenberg/binance-ruby.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/Jakenberg/binance-ruby) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/Jakenberg/binance-ruby/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/Jakenberg/binance-ruby)

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'binance-ruby'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install binance-ruby

## Setup

### Environment Variables

At minimum, you must configure the following environment variables:

```bash
BINANCE_API_KEY
BINANCE_SECRET_KEY
```

Additionally, Binance allows granular API key access based on the action being taken. For example, it is possible to use one API key for _only_ trade actions, while using another for withdrawal actions. You can configure this using any of the following keys:

```bash
BINANCE_READ_INFO_API_KEY
BINANCE_TRADING_API_KEY
BINANCE_WITHDRAWALS_API_KEY
```

If any one of these keys are not defined, `binance-ruby` will fallback to `BINANCE_API_KEY`.

## Usage

I highly recommend reading the [official Binance documentation](https://github.com/binance-exchange/binance-official-api-docs) before using this gem. Anything missed here is surely well explained there.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
